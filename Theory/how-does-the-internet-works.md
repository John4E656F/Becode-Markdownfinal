# What exactly is the Internet?
The internet is a network that connects a number of computers using that device's IP address and sends various types of data to form a global network.
With the use of fiber optic and wireless technology, the Internet connects many networks such as academic, organization, private, public, and business.
The Internet is useful for e-mail, entertainment, software downloads, information, and services, among other things.

# What Is the Internet and How Does It Work?
The internet connects the entire country. You may believe that the internet is provided by a satellite network, but this is not the case. An optical fiber cable is used to connect computers to the Internet. If our phone does not have a cable, it will get a signal from the tower, which is connected to an optical fiber cable.

# How Did the Internet Find You?
Before the internet can reach your home, it must first pass via a tier company. That company has laid down optical fiber cables or underwater cables all over the world. That will only connect the country's biggest city.

# What exactly is a network packet?
When a user wants to upload an image, for example, the image file doesn’t go from a web server to that user’s computer in its entirety. It’s broken down into “packets” of data sent via wires, cables, and internet radio waves to be reassembled by the user’s device into the desired image.

Everything that happens on the internet involves packets—from web pages and digital telecommunications to emails.
